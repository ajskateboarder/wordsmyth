Wordsmyth is a free and open-source tool to ease the pains of manual comment analysis among content creators and users.

Instead of relying on star ratings given by the user, Wordsmyth **generates them** based on the **text sentiment** using a pair of models and well-tested output finetuning.

## Highlights

- Works on almost any platform and very easy to extend
- 85-100% accuracy (tested against Amazon reviews) and sometimes more accurate than user ratings
- Accessible to anybody (planned browser extension, web dashboard, API, and command line)
