## Usage

Clone the repository with `--depth=1` because there is a large file in the Git history and it would take years to download without the flag.
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/themysticsavages/ytstars
cd ytstars
```

Get prerequisites:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
./manage dlmodel
```
