It's awful. I will add a pic soon that shows how it opened with half of it flipped/cupped up. It's supposed to pop open to the dome shape but the joints that allow the umbrella to fold don't flip well and remain bent midway so that it looks like a big bowl on top. You have to manually flip the edges down all the way around. Also the handle & shaft are cheaply made, not sturdy. I don't mind it not being an auto pop up, but that you have to manipulate it more after you extend it out,  plus the low quality construction made it a deal breaker  So glad I checked it before giving it as a gift, that would have been so embarrassing.

When pushing the umbrella back in after opening it for the first time, if it twists at all in the very slightest when pushing it back in and it WILL, the tracks on the back of the button do not line up to the release pin.  They become misaligned so that it cannot be reopened again.
