I can't get behind the dryer without moving both the washer and dryer and they are HEAVY.  So being lazy I decided to clean the vent from the outside of the house inward.  I didn't use a vacuum cleaner or a blower or suction of any kind.  I did tighten each section of tubing with pliers and taped them.  I threaded all 24 foot of tubing with the brush on the end into the outside vent and then backed it out.  I got a good amount of lint clods out.  Then I turned on the dryer to blow everything out.  I got no air coming out at all.  My fear had come true, I had forced gobs of lint into the right-angles at the end of the run.  I still didn't want to move that washer and dryer so I figured I'd try one other thing, use the clodbuster attachment.  Now I'm really getting lazy so I tightened each tubing section by hand (no pliers) and didn't use tape.  I pushed all 24 foot of tubing into the vent until I hit some resistance and then turned the tubing by hand (too lazy to hook the drill up).  Then I pulled it all out and there wasn't any lint at all that came out. So now I'm resigned to having to move the washer and dryer, but before I do I figured I might as well turn the dryer on and see what happens.  Lots of lint clods blew out and kept coming out for about 20 seconds.  I've attached pictures of it.  I'm really happy with this product and if it worked for me with all the shortcuts I took it will probably work great for you.  As a point of reference we built this house five years ago and this is the first time I ever cleaned the vent.  A load of ten bath towels used to take 45 minutes to dry, lately it's been taking 3 to 4 hours, so I knew I couldn't put cleaning the pipe off any longer."}{"emojis": [":expressionless:", ":neutral_face:", ":confused:", ":angry:", ":rage:", ":persevere:", ":confounded:", ":sweat:", ":sweat_smile:", ":unamused:", ":grimacing:", ":flushed:", ":triumph:", ":disappointed:", ":grin:", ":tired_face:", ":smile:", ":thumbsup:", ":gun:", ":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:", ":see_no_evil:", ":sleepy:", ":no_good:", ":weary:", ":pensive:", ":cry:", ":information_desk_person:", ":blush:", ":joy:", ":wink:", ":sunglasses:", ":sob:", ":mask:", ":skull:", ":relieved:", ":facepunch:", ":clap:", ":relaxed:", ":smirk:", ":pray:", ":speak_no_evil:", ":hand:", ":raised_hands:", ":v:", ":smiling_imp:", ":sparkles:", ":eyes:", ":yum:", ":ok_hand:", ":muscle:", ":sleeping:", ":broken_heart:", ":heart_eyes:", ":100:", ":blue_heart:", ":heart:", ":purple_heart:", ":yellow_heart:", ":heartbeat:", ":sparkling_heart:", ":two_hearts:", ":notes:", ":kissing_heart:", ":musical_note:"], "text": "I bought this last October and finally got around to cleaning our 15-foot dryer duct run. It's just not the type of thing that's at the top of your list... like \"Wow, should I go see a movie, or clean our dryer duct?\" However, our dryer was drying slower and slower, and I knew it was a task that I needed to tackle, so I read the very long instruction book for this and began my work. The instructions really need to be re-written and simplified. My Sony TV has a smaller instruction manual. But I do appreciate the manufacturer's thoroughness. For those of you with short attention spans here's my quick start guide:\n\n1. Screw the rods together and use electrical or duct tape to reinforce the joints to keep them from unscrewing during your work.\n2. Stick one end of rod in your drill and set the clutch pretty close to the lowest or second lowest setting, then increase power if you need it.\n3. Attached brush to other end of rod with supplied key wrench / allen wrench and tighten.\n4. Make sure your drill is on clockwise - not reverse - mode or else the rods will unscrew inside your duct and you're screwed.\n5. Read #4 again.\n6. Turn dryer on air mode and then insert the brush in the pipe outside and begin spinning it by activating the drill. Push it in about a foot, then pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then push it in 2 feet and pull it out and watch the lint fly. Then 3 feet... etc.\n7. Marvel at how much lint came out.\n8. Marvel at how fast your dryer is and come write a review here.\n9. Wash the clothes you were wearing when you did this because they are now covered in lint.\n\nHope this helps. It's a quick job and well worth it the trouble!"}{"emojis": [":rage:", ":angry:", ":triumph:", ":facepunch:", ":expressionless:", ":confused:", ":neutral_face:", ":thumbsup:", ":unamused:", ":grimacing:", ":confounded:", ":persevere:", ":disappointed:", ":cry:", ":sweat:", ":mask:", ":flushed:", ":v:", ":smiling_imp:", ":no_good:", ":gun:", ":smile:", ":clap:", ":pensive:", ":sleepy:", ":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:", ":wink:", ":hand:", ":sweat_smile:", ":blush:", ":pray:", ":broken_heart:", ":muscle:", ":sunglasses:", ":grin:", ":see_no_evil:", ":tired_face:", ":eyes:", ":ok_hand:", ":information_desk_person:", ":joy:", ":sleeping:", ":relaxed:", ":100:", ":heart:", ":skull:", ":weary:", ":raised_hands:", ":purple_heart:", ":yellow_heart:", ":blue_heart:", ":smirk:", ":relieved:", ":speak_no_evil:", ":sob:", ":heartbeat:", ":sparkles:", ":sparkling_heart:", ":kissing_heart:", ":yum:", ":two_hearts:", ":heart_eyes:", ":notes:", ":musical_note:"], "text": "Anyone who thinks they don't have a problem with lint should look at these pictures.  My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.

Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!"}{"emojis": [":rage:", ":angry:", ":confused:", ":disappointed:", ":cry:", ":neutral_face:", ":expressionless:", ":persevere:", ":confounded:", ":triumph:", ":sweat:", ":thumbsup:", ":grimacing:", ":broken_heart:", ":unamused:", ":pensive:", ":pray:", ":smile:", ":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:", ":sweat_smile:", ":flushed:", ":sleepy:", ":wink:", ":clap:", ":blush:", ":gun:", ":v:", ":smiling_imp:", ":facepunch:", ":tired_face:", ":see_no_evil:", ":grin:", ":relaxed:", ":eyes:", ":heartbeat:", ":yellow_heart:", ":sunglasses:", ":weary:", ":sob:", ":ok_hand:", ":raised_hands:", ":heart:", ":joy:", ":mask:", ":no_good:", ":speak_no_evil:", ":hand:", ":purple_heart:", ":smirk:", ":blue_heart:", ":100:", ":skull:", ":relieved:", ":sparkles:", ":sparkling_heart:", ":muscle:", ":yum:", ":information_desk_person:", ":notes:", ":kissing_heart:", ":sleeping:", ":two_hearts:", ":heart_eyes:", ":musical_note:"], "text": "So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old:  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.

This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!"}{"emojis": [":rage:", ":angry:", ":confused:", ":disappointed:", ":cry:", ":neutral_face:", ":expressionless:", ":persevere:", ":confounded:", ":triumph:", ":sweat:", ":thumbsup:", ":grimacing:", ":broken_heart:", ":unamused:", ":pensive:", ":pray:", ":smile:", ":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:", ":sweat_smile:", ":flushed:", ":sleepy:", ":wink:", ":clap:", ":blush:", ":gun:", ":v:", ":smiling_imp:", ":facepunch:", ":tired_face:", ":see_no_evil:", ":grin:", ":relaxed:", ":eyes:", ":heartbeat:", ":yellow_heart:", ":sunglasses:", ":weary:", ":sob:", ":ok_hand:", ":raised_hands:", ":heart:", ":joy:", ":mask:", ":no_good:", ":speak_no_evil:", ":hand:", ":purple_heart:", ":smirk:", ":blue_heart:", ":100:", ":skull:", ":relieved:", ":sparkles:", ":sparkling_heart:", ":muscle:", ":yum:", ":information_desk_person:", ":notes:", ":kissing_heart:", ":sleeping:", ":two_hearts:", ":heart_eyes:", ":musical_note:"], "text": "So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old:  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.

My house is only 10 years old and this is what came out of our vent.  That doesn't even include what was cleaned out from our dryer filter and what was in just the dryer unit.  This product is very easy to use.  I definitely suggest taping each junction to make sure they don't separate in the vent.  I broke my cleaning into 4 cleanings. Fist cleaning was with just the brush and the first extension.  After ensuring that section is clean I added the second and so forth until the brush came out clean.  Given the length of the brush with all four sections, I found it easier to have another set of hands guide the brush into the vent while the other set was operating the drill.\nI noticed that when I turned the dryer back on there was some lint that was dislodged and blew out the outside vent opening.  Unfortunately in my case some lodged between the slats and is keeping the vent opening from fully closing.  I will be making a trip up my ladder once the ground dries a little so I can remove those pieces.  A little price to pay for a clean vent."}{"emojis": [":thumbsup:", ":rage:", ":smile:", ":angry:", ":clap:", ":blush:", ":expressionless:", ":grimacing:", ":neutral_face:", ":ok_hand:", ":confounded:", ":relaxed:", ":confused:", ":sweat_smile:", ":persevere:", ":sweat:", ":wink:", ":grin:", ":gun:", ":disappointed:", ":triumph:", ":raised_hands:", ":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:", ":sunglasses:", ":unamused:", ":pray:", ":flushed:", ":cry:", ":muscle:", ":facepunch:", ":see_no_evil:", ":mask:", ":v:", ":pensive:", ":heart:", ":relieved:", ":sleepy:", ":tired_face:", ":yellow_heart:", ":purple_heart:", ":yum:", ":joy:", ":smirk:", ":blue_heart:", ":speak_no_evil:", ":sparkles:", ":smiling_imp:", ":weary:", ":eyes:", ":heartbeat:", ":kissing_heart:", ":sob:", ":100:", ":sparkling_heart:", ":information_desk_person:", ":heart_eyes:", ":broken_heart:", ":no_good:", ":two_hearts:", ":skull:", ":hand:", ":sleeping:", ":notes:", ":musical_note:"], "text": "Works great. I used it and an extension kit with extra rods to to clean a 21 foot long vent with a two right angle turns and it did a fantastic job with the adapter that lets you put the rod through and attach a shop vac. Got a TON of lint out, about a 5 gallon bucket full. Inside of the vent was left shiny and clean. Good for safety especially with such a long vent and to my surprise the dryer actually works quite a bit better now. On the auto cycle I used to have to run it again if I was drying heavy things like jeans or blankets/comforters etc... to fully dry things. Now it does it in one cycle and take about 25% less time to go through the auto dry cycle.\n\nI was just wanting to clean out a potential fire hazard but it really does make a big difference running through a dirty vent vs. a clean one.

I watched the process and thought, *I* should be doing this if thats all it is!\n\nI did my research, LintEater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase. Youve got to love Amazon Prime!\n\nLike with ANY product, you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones. The bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didn't read the manual or watch YouTube videos to get an idea of how the process works.\n\nThe pictures of the twisted rod? Someone had one of more of these: Speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\nDisconnected or broke in the vent pipe? The rods cant come apart if you run the drill ONLY clockwise. Thats simple physics they simply cant come apart IF you use clockwise ONLY. The brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod; speed too high, clutch too high or didn't use a clutched drill at all, pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe.\n\n- CLOCKWISE ONLY for both going into and back out of the vent tube!\n\n- My cordless drill is a Ridgid model R82005 3/8. The clutch goes from 0 to 16.5. It has a switch marked 1 & 2 for overall speed. I set the clutch to FOUR and the speed to ONE. You're not drilling holes or driving screws... you're not going as hard and fast as you can. Slow and easy wins this particular race.\n\n- I put red Loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod AND to the set screw.\n\n- As I added each section, I tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section. THEN, I wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections. This is all just common sense insurance against disaster.\n\n- The female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck aren't knurled, but I had no problem with them spinning in the chuck. Slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issue.\n\nNOTE: I didn't think Id need the extra rod extensions, but I do and came back to order them. To get this done for now, I had to do half from inside the house and half from outside.\n\n- INSIDE the house, vent pipe disconnected from the dryer, I used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a Ridgid 6HP shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert. This worked fantastically well; I had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint.\n\n- OUTSIDE the house, I didn't bother with the vacuum, figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly. Turn the dryer ON to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe, wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go!"}{"emojis": [":rage:", ":angry:", ":confused:", ":disappointed:", ":cry:", ":neutral_face:", ":expressionless:", ":persevere:", ":confounded:", ":triumph:", ":sweat:", ":thumbsup:", ":grimacing:", ":broken_heart:", ":unamused:", ":pensive:", ":pray:", ":smile:", ":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:", ":sweat_smile:", ":flushed:", ":sleepy:", ":wink:", ":clap:", ":blush:", ":gun:", ":v:", ":smiling_imp:", ":facepunch:", ":tired_face:", ":see_no_evil:", ":grin:", ":relaxed:", ":eyes:", ":heartbeat:", ":yellow_heart:", ":sunglasses:", ":weary:", ":sob:", ":ok_hand:", ":raised_hands:", ":heart:", ":joy:", ":mask:", ":no_good:", ":speak_no_evil:", ":hand:", ":purple_heart:", ":smirk:", ":blue_heart:", ":100:", ":skull:", ":relieved:", ":sparkles:", ":sparkling_heart:", ":muscle:", ":yum:", ":information_desk_person:", ":notes:", ":kissing_heart:", ":sleeping:", ":two_hearts:", ":heart_eyes:", ":musical_note:"], "text": "So, this is what life comes down to when you are 50 years old:  reviewing dryer vent cleaners while sitting at your kitchen table waiting for American Idol.
