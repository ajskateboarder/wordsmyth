Next, I tried this brand of Mg Glycinate. It decreased my anxiety to the point of putting me to sleep so I only take it at bedtime now. Not sure if this is related but I seem to have more strength and stamina in my workouts at the gym since taking this. Mg Taurate is supposed to be best for heart issues.

I wasn't taking it regularly but felt I was probably getting *some* benefit. Fast forward a few months and I find out Im pregnant. I have the normal morning sickness and debilitating fatigue a lot of women go through. Around 8 weeks I take a turn for the worse and all of a sudden I am having palpitations. They start out as being annoying and infrequent but turn into near constant, with huge flip flops of my heart and non stop fluttering, coughing, and discomfort. Supposedly some palpitations are normal for pregnancy but this was substantial. I go to my OBGYN who is immediately concerned and refers me to a cardiologist. I am so sick at her office I call my partner to come meet me because Im not even sure I can make it home. The nausea and palpitations are that overwhelming.Some time that evening I remember a book I read about Vitamin D deficiency and how once you raise your D levels its extremely important to supplement with Magnesium as well. I had just gotten the results back from my D test that I was HIGH, thats what the doc thinks anyway, I believe Im finally at optimal levels. But that also means I am probably incredibly magnesium deficient between that and my increased blood volume from pregnancy. I immediately take one of these capsules for the evening. The next morning I take another, as well as one that evening. If it were up to my Western Doc she would have told me 300mg MAX which is like barely enough to move the needle at all.3 days. Thats how long it took for me to go from non-stop palpitations, like keeping me up all night palpitations, to nothing. 85% improvement in 48 hours and then just gone. I've kept a maintenance dose of 1 of these capsules just to see how I feel and so far so good. Not only are the palpitations gone and Ive cancelled my cardiologist appointment, but my fatigue is also gone. Nausea reduced by 80% as well. What kills me is when I told my doc all that had resolved and her only response was a chuckle and \"I doubt you're magnesium deficient but you can take 300 MG if you want\" UGHHHH. Meanwhile the treatment for pre-eclampsia in pregnancy which is high blood pressure and can be accompanied with all kinds of heart problems is guess what?? IV magnesium!!So to summarize, your doctor may be absolutely clueless (most likely) and it is up to you to do your research and find the info that might literally save your life.

Magnesium is a fantastic supplement, and it is relatively cheap to purchase. Alongside vitamin D3, K2, Zinc, and Selenium. Magnesium is the most important nutrient for the modern person, as we are all below optimal levels. After extensively researching the benefits of such.After Vitamin D, Magnesium remains the most widespread deficiency. Most individuals across the globe, especially those in America, are horribly lacking in this vital mineral, partly due to soil depletion, and also due to an unhealthy modern diet. Therefore, almost everyone should supplement with magnesium.NERVOUS/ENDOCRINE: Magnesium plays a role in a plethora of activities within the human body, as well as in the brain. Magnesium plays a massive role in the regulation of serotonin, and especially in the production of melatonin. Supplementing with magnesium will act as a mild antidepressant, as well as a sleep aid. I have personally used it as a sleep aid, and it is phenomenal. It brings a wave of calmness and clarity upon the body before sleeping, which allows a deep, restorative sleep. This is reason enough to make magnesium a part of your supplemental arsenal.MUSCULAR: The mineral also plays a role in reducing cramps and allowing muscles to fully recover from a contraction, which leads to better recovery and less muscle tension throughout the day. If you work out, you should take magnesium, as it assists in lactic acid removal, which will minimize delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and speed recovery.SKELETAL: Magnesium also involves itself with bone formation, alongside calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin K2. If you wish to avoid problems such as osteoporosis, weak joints, stress fractures, or other physiological injuries involving bone structures, you must ingest adequate amounts of these 4 nutrients, as they are synergistic. This applies to teeth as well as bones.\n", "overall": 5}, {"reviewText": "\nIf I don\u2019t use magnesium I wake up with restless legs.

Especially if you\u2019re taking, or took two or more a day.For those reviewers claiming that they took 1-2 tablets and had severe side effects (arrhythmias, was mentioned in one review) that they attribute to \u2018high dose magnesium\u2019 - rest assured that one of these tablets does NOT contain 500mg of magnesium. So the side effects may have been an intolerance or allergic response to another compound in this formula, or something entirely unrelated, or your magnesium levels were already high and another 70mg was more than your heart could tolerate. High doses or high levels of magnesium can cause arrhythmia.With all of that said, I\u2019m going to switch brands because this just is not cost effective.

The label does state that the product contains 500 mg of magnesium glycinate and suggests 1-2 capsules per day, but it does not say how much magnesium is in the product.

Magnesium glycinate contains 14.1% magnesium by mass, which means that each capsule only contains 70.5 mg of magnesium.I am magnesium deficient and take 400-600 mg of magnesium per day for restless legs, migraines, and heart issues.  That means that in order to get as much magnesium as I need per day, I have to take 6 capsules, so one bottle is only a 20 day supply.I am displeased with myself for not digging deeper before making this purchase, but also not happy with the company for labelling the product in a way that conceals the actual magnesium content and the true cost.  For people who suffer neurological and cardiovascular issues as a result of magnesium deficiency, it is vital to take a sufficient dose of supplemental magnesium.  Failure to do so can lead to serious health issues.I don't know why this company chooses not to properly label their product, but consumers need to know what they're actually receiving so they can make correct dosing decisions and accurate price comparisons.

This new company has a bright future far as I'm concerned.Magnesium is an important mineral that cleans the colon and dissolves calcium in the body so it can get into the bones. It also has a positive effect on blood pressure. This form of glycinate is probably the best on the market for its absorbability.
