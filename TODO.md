# TODO.md

### Todo

- [ ] Make a website which
  - [ ] has a decent UI
  - [ ] scrapes top video comments daily
  - [ ] and stores them in a DB (like MongoDB)

### In progress

- [ ] Migrate from VADER to MIRANDA so everything isn't marked as neutral
- [ ] Use that little fork of youtube-comment-downloader which checks for replies until my PR gets merged
