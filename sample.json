I wasn't taking it regularly but felt I was probably getting *some* benefit. Fast forward a few months and I find out Im pregnant. I have the normal morning sickness and debilitating fatigue a lot of women go through. Around 8 weeks I take a turn for the worse and all of a sudden I am having palpitations. They start out as being annoying and infrequent but turn into near constant, with huge flip flops of my heart and non stop fluttering, coughing, and discomfort. Supposedly some palpitations are normal for pregnancy but this was substantial. I go to my OBGYN who is immediately concerned and refers me to a cardiologist. I am so sick at her office I call my partner to come meet me because Im not even sure I can make it home. The nausea and palpitations are that overwhelming.Some time that evening I remember a book I read about Vitamin D deficiency and how once you raise your D levels its extremely important to supplement with Magnesium as well. I had just gotten the results back from my D test that I was HIGH, thats what the doc thinks anyway, I believe Im finally at optimal levels. But that also means I am probably incredibly magnesium deficient between that and my increased blood volume from pregnancy. I immediately take one of these capsules for the evening. The next morning I take another, as well as one that evening. If it were up to my Western Doc she would have told me 300mg MAX which is like barely enough to move the needle at all.3 days. Thats how long it took for me to go from non-stop palpitations, like keeping me up all night palpitations, to nothing. 85% improvement in 48 hours and then just gone. I've kept a maintenance dose of 1 of these capsules just to see how I feel and so far so good. Not only are the palpitations gone and Ive cancelled my cardiologist appointment, but my fatigue is also gone. Nausea reduced by 80% as well. What kills me is when I told my doc all that had resolved and her only response was a chuckle and \"I doubt you're magnesium deficient but you can take 300 MG if you want\" UGHHHH. Meanwhile the treatment for pre-eclampsia in pregnancy which is high blood pressure and can be accompanied with all kinds of heart problems is guess what?? IV magnesium!!So to summarize, your doctor may be absolutely clueless (most likely) and it is up to you to do your research and find the info that might literally save your life.

So since I haven't really felt any difference in sleep or pain reduction in body or headaches (I have chronic migraine and fibromyalgia which is why I take extra magnesium), I'm a little skeptical how they managed to get 500 mg In such a small capsule and if it's being effective. I haven't felt any worse so there is some benefit. I'm researching more on this brand to see if can find out more on their process that makes the little capsule so concentrated.  If you need just a little extra magnesium and want an easy to swallow pill, I'd still recommend this product even if I don't purchase again myself.\n", "overall": 4}, {"reviewText": "\nI\u2019m always skeptical of things like this and if I\u2019ll notice a difference. I don\u2019t know if I can truly attribute it to this, but I never dream, and lately I have. I\u2019ve been waking up before my alarm and just feeling awake. Could just be getting enough sleep for once, could be this\n", "overall": 4}, {"reviewText": "\nI asked the company that sells this if it was ok to open the capsules and they assure me it was.  They did not tell me it tasted like trying to eat fish that been dead for a very long time, and it\u2019s also very bitter.Too bad, since it exactly the product I needed.\n", "overall": 3}, {"reviewText": "\nHoly cow these knock me out. I'm aware Magnesium is important and we're all probably deficient, I haven't noticed any remarkable changes in my health but I find them magical for sleeping!\n", "overall": 5}, {"reviewText": "\nI\u2019ve had killer leg cramps at night since chemo 3 yrs ago. Excruciating! I\u2019ve tried other mags but this by far keeps them at bay. One a day and no more cramps. If I miss a day of this mag I know it because I\u2019ll get them that night. Great stuff!\n", "overall": 5}, {"reviewText": "\nEasy to swallow and I have had a noticeable difference especially in my sleep patterns.  I would recommend highly.\n", "overall": 4}, {"reviewText": "\nI like this product from this company, worth the price. Just arrived in a box 15 times its size with no bubble wrap or paper to keep from breaking. I opened bottle, sealed very well, no product was damaged. I was just surprised that it was shipped this way\n", "overall": 4}, {"reviewText": "\nEasy to swallow and based on how I feel, believe it is quickly absorbed in the body.\n", "overall": 4}, {"reviewText": "\nWas suggested by my Dr to take I was only getting a few hours of sleep now getting 7-8 what a life saver. Highly recommended.\n", "overall": 5}, {"reviewText": "\nI\u2019ve been following a neuro specialist on tictok who suggested this supplement for brain health, pain management, anxiety and restful sleep!
