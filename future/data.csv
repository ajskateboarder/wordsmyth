0,"<I believe I've listened to at least half of all the youtubers who talk about Crypto. You are easily the best most knowledgeable one.  Your information is priceless and i find it truly baffling as youtubers completely look at TA and ignore the bigger narrative of why there is a pump. Btc pumped due to the future ETF release, It's kind of irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peak of BTC.The entire space has always been volatile that's why we must always back up our crypto so that you do not have to be bothered when it goes bearish.I have always played safe in the space with a less talked about medium, trad ing.Rather than buying the dip and waiting for a pump, I just get to trade my assets with insight and signal provision from Mr. Michael E. Fred I have made over 14 btc in November alone.>.",neu,0.3172856,0.46765536,0.21505901,neg 0.9590077996253967

If [estimated first year income] doesn't [reach 3x recoupment] then leave.

34,So I have a question for you. Forgive me but I have to set things up a little bit first. Let's assume that Elon musk is going to be successful and there will be a million people living on the surface of Mars. We can extrapolate that there's probably going to be lots of people living and working on the moon and traveling in between Earth Moon and Mars if that's the case. What I'm getting at is that there's a lot of communications that goes on between an individual and the rest of society that is largely ported through either a cell phone or a laptop. If you have a million people on Mars and each one has a cell phone and a laptop and one of them wants to order something locally like pizza right they call the local pizza guy and the guy says okay yeah I'll have it to your place in a minute you know. That's all fine and good that's just like we do it here but what I'm interested in is if you have someone living on Mars and they pull up an application like Facebook and it's a 20 minute delay at The far side of the orbit for a radio signal to make it from Mars to Earth and that's not counting whether or not it has to go through extra transmission points and whether those transmission points have very good data capacity or so forth. How will a person working on Mars who owns a cell phone how will that cell phone have to be programmed differently or the cell towers on Mars or the satellites around Mars and so forth all these the systems that it has to go through has to have software to run this communication. I would be interested in seeing what you would have to say about the programming necessary that would be unique to that situation.,neu,0.07887378,0.6456063,0.27551994,neg 0.8823111057281494
