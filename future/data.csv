"Obviously 1mil+ views can't be wrong but unfortunately, I gave up 30minutes in. The keyboard shortcuts were hard to follow but I managed. The killer though, the steps you use for authenticating via Postman into the API no longer exist in current versions of Postman and, being a beginner, I simply don't know what to do. Then the method you used to set environment variables no longer exists (environment variables do exist but have changed.) Unfortunately, you don't really explain what you are doing as much as just ""do this."" When I can't do this due to GUI changes in Postman, I am stuck. I found myself floundering so much I am giving up and moving to a more current version of Postman/API training.",neg,0.99997306

"This is just fantastic!!  APIs were so opaque to me.  Now I get it.  A lot clearer. And this is coming from someone who barely knows a line of code.  

Having said that, is there a crash course I can do that teaches me the bare basics of python needed to access APIs without having to learn the stuff that I won't use ‚Äì if I'm just interested in accessing APIs?

Thanks again. :)",pos,0.99854714

"Please keep a constant level of volume and pronunciation. You drop off in volume and intelligibility at the end of each sentence, which makes it difficult to understand.

"This guy is so annoying. He knows his stuff and I need the information, and it's well-organized -- however his personality is so weird that I have to constantly rewind because his ""theater"" is so distracting from the information flow.  It absorbs 80% of my brain power just to cancel out the noise of his cringe mannerisms. His ""performance"" is like he's talking to 6 year old children, and he obviously thinks he's cute and entertaining. Hint: you're insulting the intelligence of your audience and I'd think even children would recognize this as b.s. ... Free Code Camp: just know that a rock star is somebody who can focus on delivering the goods, not somebody who thinks he is a Disney princess. You have a lot of great teachers but not this guy; he needs an education about the real world and to unplug from Sesame Street.. Craig: Here's one of many good examples of how to teach purely and simply, just delivering the information without injecting personality quirks. It's by an actual woman, not a guy pretending to be a woman or trying to ingratiate himself with women. Learn from her please.

"Really good and clear tutorial. Well paced and explained. Just a note to a few people: when you get to the Twilio section, if your mobile number is based outside the US&Canada, the Twilio API will shift the MediaURL value into the BODY as plain text. It still gets sent by the API and received by the mobile device but is received as a link on the mobile device. Therefore the next stage when you try to GET the gif you have just sent will not work. Took me ages to work this out! 
* It would be really useful to add a flag / annotation to the video at this point so people outside North America do not think they have made a mistake and lose time / give up *",pos,0.9921009
