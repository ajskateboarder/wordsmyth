i feel like if you built 1 small thing each stream instead of big projects and you where more engaged with your viewers as well as coding since its a small simple project it wont be that hard to do both but i do agree with you i've tried streaming my projects and it just would not pick up any traction. and i think if you did your big project in the off time of your stream and you updated your viewers on what you have done i feel like that would be a better option than streaming the code live or you could make the coding of your big project into a Youtube video kinda like a dev log and promote it in your twitch streams,pos,0.06679908,0.45585606,0.47734484

"very late, but I think live coding can be good entertainment-wise, as long as it's something interesting that you can make relatively constant viewable progress on
If you can write a small part of what you're working on, then show immediately the results of that, that's interesting imo, tho this is mainly a gamedev person talking",pos,0.0059465473,0.08666321,0.9073903

"simple, streaming code is less popular than streaming games because coding is less popular than gaming.

"I used to livestream code, and what ended up kind of working for me was making micro projects. Pretty much game jam level problems, working with tech I already knew really well, and hacking things in super fast without caring about code quality. This let me get back to playtesting the game faster, and make the streams more entertaining. This is totally correct though, for anything even remotely challenging, the livestream was just the worst place to do it. Twitch chat completely breaks progress. I ended up spending most of my time in the streams ""teaching"" or just explaining how things work, and very little time actually writing code.",neg,0.48689497,0.3395253,0.17357977
"It's actually pretty beneficial to see a pro struggle with an unexpected error for a few reasons. First it's a good ego boost, resets the voices in your head telling you you're the only one that googles stuff for days with no hope in sight, an then you get carried along the whole thought process of fixing the damn thing. The downtime is a downside though so it's not entirely efficient, maybe a stream supercut on youtube would be even better.",pos,0.16448519,0.30741248,0.52810234

"This is odd, George Hotz has no issues with live streaming programming activities. I have had  success coding along with twitchslam and other projects. Please do some more programming renders as they are helpful to people imo way more than the placebo effect of comprehending vlogs. Im glad you have great goals for your start ups but i find those vlogs vague and too short. I follow you bc of your brain, and would imagine in my ignorance of business ventures that your success comes intrinsically from your ideas being fleshed out. Im probably in the minority but a live stream programming render from you would be valuable in whatever incomplete or imperfect form that it is.

"I recently found a good place for coding livestreams. Im maintaining a quite large OSS project, and we have some difficulty involving the users in the development process of the library. So i started lifestreaming some of the development of the project. This means people can come and hang out, ask more about quickly about issues etc. It also allows me to give a tour of the entire project really nice and quickly without having to spend hours in a discord chat going through it.

I do realise though that this doesnt apply to everyone, and your points are definitely very valid. Just thought i would share my recent experience.",pos,0.011561045,0.085331656,0.9031073
