"Really good and clear tutorial. Well paced and explained. Just a note to a few people: when you get to the Twilio section, if your mobile number is based outside the US&Canada, the Twilio API will shift the MediaURL value into the BODY as plain text. It still gets sent by the API and received by the mobile device but is received as a link on the mobile device. Therefore the next stage when you try to GET the gif you have just sent will not work. Took me ages to work this out! 
* It would be really useful to add a flag / annotation to the video at this point so people outside North America do not think they have made a mistake and lose time / give up *",pos,0.9921009

"Obviously 1mil+ views can't be wrong but unfortunately, I gave up 30minutes in. The keyboard shortcuts were hard to follow but I managed. The killer though, the steps you use for authenticating via Postman into the API no longer exist in current versions of Postman and, being a beginner, I simply don't know what to do. Then the method you used to set environment variables no longer exists (environment variables do exist but have changed.) Unfortunately, you don't really explain what you are doing as much as just ""do this."" When I can't do this due to GUI changes in Postman, I am stuck.

"Since YT got rid of the so helpful like-dislike bar, I started to leave my likes/dislikes for everybody visible directly in my comments , so here it is 👎.

Too histrionic, too many facial expressions, too many gestures, too much intonation, the voice sometimes sounds downright nagging. Less would really be more. Have you ever watched that yourself? I wonder why someone thinks that with so much artificially exaggerated (aka exalted) behaviour he conveys knowledge better, that people would listen to him better and, above all, follow him better than if he looked and talked naturally and didn't gesticulate wildly and sometimes distort his mouth into the grotesque when speaking. You are far too exuberant, over-enthusiastic about what you yourself love to do. I got it, you love it. But more objectivity and naturalness in your appearance would be more beneficial to, well, to the object and not distract from it with an excessive amount of ... showmanship, not to use another term. I found it so outlandish, even cringy, that I couldn't even make it past the first minute. I couldn't watch or listen to it any longer than that. Imagine.",neg,0.9999963

READ the GitHub course notes for Twilio section! You need to setup/tweak a environment for yourself to send a text message to yourself. Twilio at the moment won't let you ""show"" your Auth Token so you'll have to go into your account information to dig it out. 

If you had issues like I did just using the curl command, you might be running into Execution Policy issue. I ended up changing it from Restricted to ByPass to get it to work correctly.

Next, get rid of the ""\"" at the end of the code. If you are working in a PowerShell and sending that code, it'll just pop up resolve host errors. 

Happy programming peeps!",neg,0.9966484

"Awesome video! But I am a total beginner and got stuck in video 5 😬 I have no coding skills, but want to focus on learning APIs. Can anyone suggest video tutorials for what I need to learn to understand what's going on in video 5? (Am on Windows, not Mac, BTW)",pos,0.99366003
I really like how enthusiastic the tone of voice is. A very engaging show host. More tech or boring topics should be presented like this to make it friendlier for people who aren't familiar with these topics,pos,0.99632627

Enjoying the course!  It looks like Spotify’s web console isn’t a thing anymore.  I just get a page that says “Console” with no place to input anything and no curl code window.  Anyone know of a workaround or how to get at the console?,neg,0.999027

"Here for the puns - good course (personally took a lot longer than the c. 2.5hrs of the vid excluding breaks). 
Struggled initially with getting a terminal - found that I needed Git Bash (might be useful to someone new to coding).
Re Python, struggled to get it to acknowledge that I had a version so I repaired my install but was unable to activate a venv (virtual environment), this wasn't too much of an issue as I was still able to follow along with everything else.
Good overview of APIs, great range of resources to demonstrate its use.

"Just install Python. Suuure. But Python2 is default on my system since it comes with Macs, so even though I installed Python3 it uses python2 as default?

"Here I am, employed as a developer, watching a video that purports to be for beginners, and it's a great video so far. One of the things I love about approaches like this is that, especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it, there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks. For instance, I know what ""statelessness"" means generally, but then at around 23:30 Craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the context--with no extraneous details.

Nice work.",pos,0.9999049
