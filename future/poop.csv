I went from learning 1 thing at time in big monolithic chunks that put me to sleep and had me questioning my commitment - to much smaller chunks of video not longer than 10 to 15 minutes and a much larger variety of subjects and speakers to keep me fresh - much more energy using this approach. And it doesn't worry me to on-board a subject - just work it into the daily watch list - if there are too many of them just prioritise the ones you definately want to watch or shorten the daily watch time to fit them all in.
