Keep using API's the way you do and it's a matter of time that it goes horribly wrong, it's not a question of if it happens anymore because nowadays bad things happen to everyone who's doing things online.
You have been warned, what you do with this information is totally up to you.
One thing that I wouldn't teach or dare to say online is that you can use API's without knowing what happens in the background, that's bad advice so if you read this comment please don't listen to this guy, he may be able to use the API's but he has no idea what the API is capable of and what it can do without you even knowing or seeing anything that the API may be doing to your system or the server making it even more dangerous because if it sits somewhere on the server it can infect many computers, phones etc. and at the time that people finally begin to suspect that there's something wrong with their system it's already too late, who knows what happens if you don't have any knowledge of the inner workings of the API.
