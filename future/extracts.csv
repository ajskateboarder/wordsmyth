5,"When was thie video made?  The Spotify website changed and the layout is different.  Spotify seems to only have the ""Get"" request in the search API.

7,"Please keep a constant level of volume and pronunciation. You drop off in volume and intelligibility at the end of each sentence, which makes it difficult to understand. If I am the ""only one"" to have pointed it out, it means that I am one of the few who watched long enough, and I am one of the few who actually wanted to understand you ... and, I have higher standards.",neg,0.99980503,":rage:, :angry:, :thumbsup:, :triumph:, :expressionless:"

9,"This guy is so annoying. He knows his stuff and I need the information, and it's well-organized -- however his personality is so weird that I have to constantly rewind because his ""theater"" is so distracting from the information flow.  It absorbs 80% of my brain power just to cancel out the noise of his cringe mannerisms. His ""performance"" is like he's talking to 6 year old children, and he obviously thinks he's cute and entertaining. Hint: you're insulting the intelligence of your audience and I'd think even children would recognize this as b.s. ... Free Code Camp: just know that a rock star is somebody who can focus on delivering the goods, not somebody who thinks he is a Disney princess. You have a lot of great teachers but not this guy; he needs an education about the real world and to unplug from Sesame Street.. Craig: Here's one of many good examples of how to teach purely and simply, just delivering the information without injecting personality quirks. It's by an actual woman, not a guy pretending to be a woman or trying to ingratiate himself with women. Learn from her please.

17,"This is just fantastic!!  APIs were so opaque to me.  Now I get it.  A lot clearer. And this is coming from someone who barely knows a line of code.  

Having said that, is there a crash course I can do that teaches me the bare basics of python needed to access APIs without having to learn the stuff that I won't use â€“ if I'm just interested in accessing APIs?

Thanks again. :)",pos,0.99854714,":sparkles:, :heartbeat:, :blue_heart:, :two_hearts:, :purple_heart:"
