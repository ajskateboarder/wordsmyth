He knows his stuff and I need the information, and it's well-organized -- however his personality is so weird that I have to constantly rewind because his ""theater"" is so distracting from the information flow.  It absorbs 80% of my brain power just to cancel out the noise of his cringe mannerisms. His ""performance"" is like he's talking to 6 year old children, and he obviously thinks he's cute and entertaining. Hint: you're insulting the intelligence of your audience and I'd think even children would recognize this as b.s. ... Free Code Camp: just know that a rock star is somebody who can focus on delivering the goods, not somebody who thinks he is a Disney princess. You have a lot of great teachers but not this guy; he needs an education about the real world and to unplug from Sesame Street..

102,"Really good and clear tutorial. Well paced and explained. Just a note to a few people: when you get to the Twilio section, if your mobile number is based outside the US&Canada, the Twilio API will shift the MediaURL value into the BODY as plain text. It still gets sent by the API and received by the mobile device but is received as a link on the mobile device. Therefore the next stage when you try to GET the gif you have just sent will not work. Took me ages to work this out!

Too histrionic, too many facial expressions, too many gestures, too much intonation, the voice sometimes sounds downright nagging. Less would really be more. Have you ever watched that yourself? I wonder why someone thinks that with so much artificially exaggerated (aka exalted) behaviour he conveys knowledge better, that people would listen to him better and, above all, follow him better than if he looked and talked naturally and didn't gesticulate wildly and sometimes distort his mouth into the grotesque when speaking. You are far too exuberant, over-enthusiastic about what you yourself love to do. I got it, you love it. But more objectivity and naturalness in your appearance would be more beneficial to, well, to the object and not distract from it with an excessive amount of ... showmanship, not to use another term.

READ the GitHub course notes for Twilio section! You need to setup/tweak a environment for yourself to send a text message to yourself. Twilio at the moment won't let you ""show"" your Auth Token so you'll have to go into your account information to dig it out. 

If you had issues like I did just using the curl command, you might be running into Execution Policy issue. I ended up changing it from Restricted to ByPass to get it to work correctly.

Next, get rid of the ""\"" at the end of the code. If you are working in a PowerShell and sending that code, it'll just pop up resolve host errors.

Struggled initially with getting a terminal - found that I needed Git Bash (might be useful to someone new to coding).
Re Python, struggled to get it to acknowledge that I had a version so I repaired my install but was unable to activate a venv (virtual environment), this wasn't too much of an issue as I was still able to follow along with everything else.
Good overview of APIs, great range of resources to demonstrate its use.
