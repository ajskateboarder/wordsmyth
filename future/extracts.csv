He knows his stuff and I need the information, and it's well-organized -- however his personality is so weird that I have to constantly rewind because his ""theater"" is so distracting from the information flow.  It absorbs 80% of my brain power just to cancel out the noise of his cringe mannerisms. His ""performance"" is like he's talking to 6 year old children, and he obviously thinks he's cute and entertaining. Hint: you're insulting the intelligence of your audience and I'd think even children would recognize this as b.s. ... Free Code Camp: just know that a rock star is somebody who can focus on delivering the goods, not somebody who thinks he is a Disney princess. You have a lot of great teachers but not this guy; he needs an education about the real world and to unplug from Sesame Street.. Craig: Here's one of many good examples of how to teach purely and simply, just delivering the information without injecting personality quirks.

113,"Really good and clear tutorial. Well paced and explained. Just a note to a few people: when you get to the Twilio section, if your mobile number is based outside the US&Canada, the Twilio API will shift the MediaURL value into the BODY as plain text. It still gets sent by the API and received by the mobile device but is received as a link on the mobile device. Therefore the next stage when you try to GET the gif you have just sent will not work. Took me ages to work this out! 
* It would be really useful to add a flag / annotation to the video at this point so people outside North America do not think they have made a mistake and lose time / give up *",pos,0.9921009,":heartbeat:, :v:, :gun:, :yellow_heart:, :muscle:, :hand:, :musical_note:, :broken_heart:, :speak_no_evil:, :cry:"
