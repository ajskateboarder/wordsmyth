READ the GitHub course notes for Twilio section! You need to setup/tweak a environment for yourself to send a text message to yourself. Twilio at the moment won't let you ""show"" your Auth Token so you'll have to go into your account information to dig it out. 

If you had issues like I did just using the curl command, you might be running into Execution Policy issue. I ended up changing it from Restricted to ByPass to get it to work correctly.

Next, get rid of the ""\"" at the end of the code. If you are working in a PowerShell and sending that code, it'll just pop up resolve host errors.

Too histrionic, too many facial expressions, too many gestures, too much intonation, the voice sometimes sounds downright nagging. Less would really be more. Have you ever watched that yourself? I wonder why someone thinks that with so much artificially exaggerated (aka exalted) behaviour he conveys knowledge better, that people would listen to him better and, above all, follow him better than if he looked and talked naturally and didn't gesticulate wildly and sometimes distort his mouth into the grotesque when speaking. You are far too exuberant, over-enthusiastic about what you yourself love to do. I got it, you love it. But more objectivity and naturalness in your appearance would be more beneficial to, well, to the object and not distract from it with an excessive amount of ... showmanship, not to use another term. I found it so outlandish, even cringy, that I couldn't even make it past the first minute. I couldn't watch or listen to it any longer than that.

229,"This guy is so annoying. He knows his stuff and I need the information, and it's well-organized -- however his personality is so weird that I have to constantly rewind because his ""theater"" is so distracting from the information flow.  It absorbs 80% of my brain power just to cancel out the noise of his cringe mannerisms. His ""performance"" is like he's talking to 6 year old children, and he obviously thinks he's cute and entertaining. Hint: you're insulting the intelligence of your audience and I'd think even children would recognize this as b.s. ... Free Code Camp: just know that a rock star is somebody who can focus on delivering the goods, not somebody who thinks he is a Disney princess. You have a lot of great teachers but not this guy; he needs an education about the real world and to unplug from Sesame Street.. Craig: Here's one of many good examples of how to teach purely and simply, just delivering the information without injecting personality quirks. It's by an actual woman, not a guy pretending to be a woman or trying to ingratiate himself with women. Learn from her please.
