I recently followed this video and now Twilio and postman needs you to add MessagingServiceSid in the send message block. So please check it and make sure you add the key and value otherwise it will not get sent.,:eyes:,0,"[':eyes:', ':skull:', ':flushed:', ':neutral_face:', ':confused:', ':joy:', ':sweat_smile:', ':smile:', ':see_no_evil:', ':expressionless:']",False,pos,neu

"Here I am, employed as a developer, watching a video that purports to be for beginners, and it's a great video so far. One of the things I love about approaches like this is that, especially for developers like me who just picked up some crap over time and am doing stuff with it, there are lots of fundamentals that slip through those autodidactic cracks. For instance, I know what ""statelessness"" means generally, but then at around 23:30 Craig explains not only clearly but completely enough for the context--with no extraneous detail

Nice work.",:thumbsup:,0,"[':thumbsup:', ':100:', ':confused:', ':blue_heart:', ':clap:', ':cry:', ':raised_hands:', ':facepunch:', ':pensive:', ':pray:']",True,pos,pos

"Since YT got rid of the so helpful like-dislike bar, I started to leave my likes/dislikes for everybody visible directly in my comments , so here it is 👎.

 histrionic, too many facial expressions, too many gestures, too much intonation, the voice sometimes sounds downright nagging. Less would really be more. Have you ever watched that yourself? I wonder why someone thinks that with so much artificially exaggerated (aka exalted) behaviour he conveys knowledge better, that people would listen to him better and, above all, follow him better than if he looked and talked naturally and didn't gesticulate wildly and sometimes distort his mouth into the grotesque when speaking. You are far too exuberant, over-enthusiastic about what you yourself love to do. I got it, you love it. But more objectivity and naturalness in your appearance would be more beneficial to, well, to the object and not distract from it with an excessive amount of ... showmanship, not to use another term. I found it so outlandish, even cringy, that I couldn't even make it past the first minute. I couldn't watch or listen to it any longer than that.
