The last time I used the .NET API from M$ was 2.0 in the 2000s, when there were over 450 \"controls\" in your analogy, or Classes in Oop. What version are we up to today, and how many Classes does it contain?\n\nAs one who has taught and written books about programming, I would have talked about use of a programming environment supporting the Interface earlier in the exposition.\n\nOther than that, nice job describing this disjoint, imaginary world created by the  \"experts\" who described this layered universe.\n\nAfter 40 years helping to create and navigate this universe, I still prefer wandering the basement level of Open, Close, Read, Write, & IOCTL.",

I went from learning 1 thing at time in big monolithic chunks that put me to sleep and had me questioning my commitment - to much smaller chunks of video not longer than 10 to 15 minutes and a much larger variety of subjects and speakers to keep me fresh - much more energy using this approach. And it doesn't worry me to on-board a subject - just work it into the daily watch list - if there are too many of them just prioritise the ones you definately want to watch or shorten the daily watch time to fit them all in.

    "Yeah it's in the header where you can put some obscure code that the user doesn't see or has any idea of that it's there, you should know at least the basics of what's happening on the background of the API that you're using so you're able to recognize if the API is safe to use or that the API is giving unauthorized access to the server or the client.\nKeep using API's the way you do and it's a matter of time that it goes horribly wrong, it's not a question of if it happens anymore because nowadays bad things happen to everyone who's doing things online.\nYou have been warned, what you do with this information is totally up to you.\nOne thing that I wouldn't teach or dare to say online is that you can use API's without knowing what happens in the background, that's bad advice so if you read this comment please don't listen to this guy, he may be able to use the API's but he has no idea what the API is capable of and what it can do without you even knowing or seeing anything that the API may be doing to your system or the server making it even more dangerous because if it sits somewhere on the server it can infect many computers, phones etc. and at the time that people finally begin to suspect that there's something wrong with their system it's already too late, who knows what happens if you don't have any knowledge of the inner workings of the API.",
    "That's a very big security risk you're taking if you only use an API and you don't know how the API is working on the background, API's are the new thing that hackers are interested in because of the lack of security of the API's.\nThe first thing that I want to know of any API that I'm going to use is how it works in the background or at least how I can make use of the API in a safe way keeping hackers out.",

His \"performance\" is like he's talking to 6 year old children, and he obviously thinks he's cute and entertaining. Hint: you're insulting the intelligence of your audience and I'd think even children would recognize this as b.s. ...

    "Really good and clear tutorial. Well paced and explained. Just a note to a few people: when you get to the Twilio section, if your mobile number is based outside the US&Canada, the Twilio API will shift the MediaURL value into the BODY as plain text. It still gets sent by the API and received by the mobile device but is received as a link on the mobile device. Therefore the next stage when you try to GET the gif you have just sent will not work. Took me ages to work this out! \n* It would be really useful to add a flag / annotation to the video at this point so people outside North America do not think they have made a mistake and lose time / give up *",

    "Obviously 1mil+ views can't be wrong but unfortunately, I gave up 30minutes in. The keyboard shortcuts were hard to follow but I managed. The killer though, the steps you use for authenticating via Postman into the API no longer exist in current versions of Postman and, being a beginner, I simply don't know what to do. Then the method you used to set environment variables no longer exists (environment variables do exist but have changed.) Unfortunately, you don't really explain what you are doing as much as just \"do this.\" When I can't do this due to GUI changes in Postman, I am stuck. I found myself floundering so much I am giving up and moving to a more current version of Postman/API training.",

I'm trying to learn frameworks (spring boot specifically) and a video like this one would be amazing, but I can't find any that explain everything top to bottom for beginners.\nFor instance, there are api, dao, model and service. What is each of them ? What is the job of each ? What's the hierarchy between them ? I'm a complete beginner who has to learn this asap and a course like this one would be amazing !",

Less would really be more. Have you ever watched that yourself? I wonder why someone thinks that with so much artificially exaggerated (aka exalted) behaviour he conveys knowledge better, that people would listen to him better and, above all, follow him better than if he looked and talked naturally and didn't gesticulate wildly and sometimes distort his mouth into the grotesque when speaking. You are far too exuberant, over-enthusiastic about what you yourself love to do. I got it, you love it. But more objectivity and naturalness in your appearance would be more beneficial to, well, to the object and not distract from it with an excessive amount of ... showmanship, not to use another term. I found it so outlandish, even cringy, that I couldn't even make it past the first minute. I couldn't watch or listen to it any longer than that. Imagine.",

You need to setup/tweak a environment for yourself to send a text message to yourself. Twilio at the moment won't let you \"show\" your Auth Token so you'll have to go into your account information to dig it out. \n\nIf you had issues like I did just using the curl command, you might be running into Execution Policy issue. I ended up changing it from Restricted to ByPass to get it to work correctly.\n\nNext, get rid of the \"\\\" at the end of the code. If you are working in a PowerShell and sending that code, it'll just pop up resolve host errors. \n\nHappy programming peeps!",
