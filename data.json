Always set your root password as root so you can easily remember. Also make sure all ports are open. The more ports you have open the more security you have.

'\"Spacebar to select it Enter to go back.\"\\n\\nThe average Arch user\\'s understanding of good UX.' 'I installed Arch less than a week ago. Looked at the Wiki barely understood any of it. Thankfully I had a buddy that knew way more about Linux and Arch than me so he was able to help me and we got it knocked out in about 8 hours thanks to stuff happening like forgetting to get the stuff necessary to use ethernet. At about the 6 hour mark he told me about archinstall. Still pissed.' 'Someone at my work once said something along the lines of \"If you use Linux on a daily basis and go more into the technical side you most likely have the knowledge needed to be a Linux SysAdmin\"' 'Make Arch users seethe with this one simple trick!' \"I like Arch mostly because it's what I'm most familiar with as of now. Never used any Debian based distros on Desktop.\\nBut now days I have one computer running Fedora and it is pretty sweet as well. If you could enable RPM fusion and Flathub during install it would be my top recommendation for new users.\" \"I remember installing Arch on an old laptop when I was a kid. I had used Slackware Knoppix Puppy Linux and Ubuntu so I figured it wouldn't be that big a deal. Learned quite a lot during that 6 hour process then erased it and installed Backtrack to experiment with wifi cracking. Those were simpler days.\" 'I\\'m still amazed how someone (with charisma 100 presumably) managed to convince arch devs to include archinstall in the original distro after 20 years of being proudly \"that distro that is so hard to install you get bragging rights for doing it\". Best thing that has happened to Arch by the way an excellent one I use it myself it has always been even better now you don\\'t need to pass the trial of patience to or to resort to third-party installers or forks in order to have a bleeding-edge distro with the richest package collection (if you include AUR) available.' 'Quick edit: The archinstall on the ISO & the one he downloaded are 1 in the same.\\nIt is just an updated version which comes preinstalled on the newest ISO anyways.' 'Hey Kenny you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made an old guy laugh \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082 \\nThese Arch users haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got a clue mate. \\nWhen I started we had floppy disks and built it ourselves. If these so called elitists want to know how we used to get out machines up and running they should install Linux from scratch. \\nWe were doing it on i386 and i486 boxes \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082\\nThe fist time I installed Gentoo you had 3 tarballs not 1 like today. Theirs no elitism in Arch mate. Linux used to be about helping people new to the community. Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s turned into a dick measuring contest. If these idiots could only see how stupid they look getting all worked over an operating system. A tool that runs your programs. And here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the really stupid part. Every Linux distro is made up of the kernel and GNU tools. So all the fighting arguing is about what sits on top of that. \\nI just sit back and shake my head at the shit that some people say \u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082\u00f0\u009f\u0098\u0082' 'Came for Arch stayed for the music' \"Bro you must be some kind of mind-reader. I was just planning to finally look into this over the weekend! I really want to use vanilla Arch but I cannot for the life of me encrypt my hard disk properly or get Arch to locate the disk. I'm sure it's something stupid but I've spent far too many hours diagnosing the issue with no success.\" \"ngl I recently did my first actual arch install (as opposed to using endeavour or an installer) and honestly? it was pretty easy. the wiki is pretty clear and it really didn't take that long for me to get it installed and mostly set up.\" 'The song was in so much sync with the package download and installation\\nGreat content.\\nAlso I am an Arch user btw :D' \"I always wondered how the Arch installer looked as I've gotten so used to installing it manually. Looks like a good easy way to get Arch installed. Won't be using it though.\\n\\nFor me Arch is a nearly perfect distro. Though each distro I tried has their own problem:\\n>Arch feels like it's missing a lot of packages (the most important ones are there but some of the niche ones aren't)\\n\\n>Debian feels too out of date (an advantage for some but not for me)\\n\\n>Fedora is way too bloated (I install neofetch it installs 60 packages)\" 'Linux and hardbass go together like glove and hand haha! :D' 'I installed arch myself about a month ago. I failed commands so many times it was a real nightmare I followed the tutorial exactly... so many commands just failed or gave errors that i had no clue how to fix.
