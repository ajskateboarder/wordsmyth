This documents the inner workings, APIs, tech stacks, and other stupid things developers care about. We'll try to keep it descriptive while being as structured as possible.

## Tech Stack

### Algorithms

These are used on the backend to process comments.

#### TorchMoji

One algorithm is TorchMoji, a PyTorch implementation of [DeepMoji](https://deepmoji.mit.edu/) (originally in Tensorflow). DeepMojiWe chose TorchMoji over DeepMoji because Tensorflow abandons old PyPi versions too often and PyTorch is generally faster.

This is

#### Flair

Another is Flair, a
