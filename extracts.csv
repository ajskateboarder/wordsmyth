11,"What if you’re an employee without a YouTube channel and thousands of followers. Quitting four times makes it seem like you’re the problem not the project.

By the fourth time, based on the expertise this channel feigns, how are you not asking different questions or qualifying projects better.


If you didn’t have a YouTube channel or savings, how many people are going to be realistically in a position to quit their company? 

Just saying, sounds like he’s shitting on the projects and we of course are only hearing one side but calling a project a boat and yourself (which happens to group in your coworkers) a sailor kind of sounds like you’re shitting on people.",neg,0.022358108,0.7490661,":sweat_smile:, :flushed:, :thumbsup:, :confused:, :ok_hand:"

18,"yeah quitting start ups is fine, but not when you involve a lot of people into it, hype up everyone like it’s “the next big thing” and when developers spend hundreds of hours working on this project, community is formed, you just quit, it’s not okay to others. I personally spent a lot of time developing a bot for Doge house and bfore I finished it you quit and that was the end of my work… wasting others time is not okay",neg,0.021749547,0.82561123,":v:, :clap:, :facepunch:, :hand:, :thumbsup:"
